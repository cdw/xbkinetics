%% Drafting the Kinetics Paper
% This document is intended to be a way to organize thoughts on what should go
% into the kinetics paper and lay some rough text down.

%% Opening
% Some descriptive text

%% History of models
% Some descriptive text

%% Different XBs examined 

%% Methods

%% Images wanted
% 
% * Cartoon of different XBs used (this could be integrated into the other
% images if necessary), a comparision of these to the xray crystalization images
% would be nice
% * Potential wells of different XBs, when in each state (without accounting for,
%   and maybe with accounting for, the energies required to stretch the 
%   surrounding filaments)
% * Kinetic rates for different XBs
% * ???


% Plan of action:
%Sunday night:
% Plan and revive old code
%
%Monday:
% Produce giant matrices of potential energies
% Figure out what I am using to produce the images
% 
%Tuesday: 
% Produce giant matrices of potential wells
